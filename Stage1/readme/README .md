## Task

In stage 1 the task is to write functions for different biological events.

## Logistic Growth Curve

A graphical representation of the growth pattern of a microbial population over time, typically showing an S-shaped curve with distinct phases including a lag phase, exponential (log) phase, stationary phase, and death phase, where the growth rate initially accelerates rapidly, then slows down and eventually stabilizes as the population reaches its carrying capacity due to limited resources in the environment; essentially depicting the typical "sigmoid" growth pattern observed in many biological populations. 

#### Key points about the microbial logistic growth curve:

Phases:

Lag Phase: The initial period is when the microbial population adapts to the new environment, not actively dividing but metabolically active. 

Exponential (Log) Phase: Rapid cell division occurs at a constant rate, resulting in a logarithmic increase in population size. 

Stationary Phase: Growth slows as the population reaches the carrying capacity, with the number of dying cells balancing out the number of new cells. 

Death Phase: Population declines as the environment becomes depleted of nutrients and waste products accumulate, leading to cell death exceeding new cell production. 


### The microbial logistic growth curve equation is typically represented as: 

dN/dt = rN((K - N)/K)

where "dN/dt" represents the rate of population change
"N" is the population size at a given time
"r" is the intrinsic growth rate, and 
"K" is the carrying capacity (the maximum population size the environment can support). 

## Hamming Distance

Hamming distance between two strings or vectors of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or equivalently, the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other. In a more general context, the Hamming distance is one of several string metrics for measuring the edit distance between two sequences.
